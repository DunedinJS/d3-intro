        <h2>What is D3?</h2>
        <p>D3 is a JavaScript library which can use data to manipulate HTML and SVG.
          This makes it a powerful tool for building data visualisations.</p>
        <p>D3 does not provide a standard set of charting options 'out of the box'.
          Instead it provides lower-level functions for data transformation, physics, and HTML or SVG manipulation.</p>
        <p>Although D3 has a somewhat steep learning curve this can be attributed to its specialised
          purpose which is quite unlike any other JavaScript libraries. With some basic familiarity
          it is a greatly expressive and efficient library to work with.</p>
