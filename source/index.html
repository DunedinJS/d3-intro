      <section>
        <h2>What is D3?</h2>
        <p>D3 is a JavaScript library which can use data to manipulate HTML and SVG.
          This makes it a powerful tool for building data visualisations.</p>
        <p>D3 does not provide a standard set of charting options 'out of the box'.
          Instead it provides lower-level functions for data transformation, physics, and HTML or SVG manipulation.</p>
        <p>Although D3 has a somewhat steep learning curve this can be attributed to its specialised
          purpose which is quite unlike any other JavaScript libraries. With some basic familiarity
          it is a greatly expressive and efficient library to work with.</p>

        <h2>Chart 1</h2>
        <p>This is a simple demo to see D3 in action. Here we draw a simple bar chart with HTML elements.</p>
        <div id="chart1"></div>
        <p>Inspect this chart with your browser's developer tools.<br>
          You will see that the <code>#chart1</code> element contains a separate <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>
          for each of the eight random values in the data set and their heights are determined by those values.</p>
        <p>Also see the documented source code in <code>source/chart1.js</code><br>
          You can access this through your developer tools. In Chrome you'll find this in the Sources tab under <code>webpack://</code> host and <code>.</code> directory.</p>
