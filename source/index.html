      <h1>D3 Introduction</h1>

      <section>
        <h2>What is D3?</h2>
        <p>D3 is a JavaScript library which can use data to manipulate HTML and SVG.
          This makes it a powerful tool for building data visualisations.</p>
        <p>D3 does not provide a standard set of charting options 'out of the box'.
          Instead it provides lower-level functions for data transformation, physics, and HTML or SVG manipulation.</p>
        <p>Although D3 has a somewhat steep learning curve this can be attributed to its specialised
          purpose which is quite unlike any other JavaScript libraries. With some basic familiarity
          it is a greatly expressive and efficient library to work with.</p>

      <section>
        <h2>Chart 1 &mdash; HTML bar chart</h2>
        <p>This is a simple demo to see D3 in action. Here we draw a simple bar chart with HTML elements.</p>
        <div id="chart1"></div>
        <p>Hover over the bars to see their values.</p>
        <p>Inspect this chart with your browser's developer tools.<br>
          You will see that the <code>#chart1</code> element contains a separate <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>
          for each of the eight random values in the data set and their heights are determined by those values.</p>
        <p>Also see the documented source code in <code>source/chart1.js</code></p>
      </section>

      <blockquote>
        <p>An issue which you might have noticed in Chart 1 is that the chart height relates directly to the largest data value.</p>
        <p>For example in <code>source/chart1.js</code>, change <code>const max = 1000;</code>.<br>
          You will see that the chart is rendered much taller because the values are much larger numbers.</p>
        <p>This leads us into Chart 2 which introduces scales.</p>
      </blockquote>

      <section>
        <h2>Chart 2 &mdash; HTML bar chart with scaling</h2>
        <p>A simple HTML bar chart with scaling of the bar heights.</p>
        <p>A linear scale is used here to determine the bar heights.
          No matter what the largest value is, its bar will have a height of 100 pixels.</p>
        <p>D3 also provides other scale types such as time, and logarithmic.</p>
        <div id="chart2"></div>
        <p>Hover over the bars to see their values.</p>
        <p>See the documented source code in <code>source/chart2.js</code></p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Chart 3 &mdash; SVG line chart</h2>
        <p>A simple line chart which plots values over time.
          This renders an inline SVG and draws a path from the data.
          SVG graphics are used because they offer much more visual features than plain HTML elements.</p>
        <p>A linear scale is used here to scale the X axis to the chart height and a time scale is used to scale Y axis to the chart width.</p>
        <p>The path drawn with a straight lines between points but it is also possible to specify other curve functions.
          See the <a href="https://github.com/d3/d3-shape/blob/master/README.md#curves" target="_blank">D3 curves documentation</a> for details.</p>

      <section>
        <h2>Chart 4 &mdash; SVG heatmap</h2>
        <p>A heatmap which plots values over time.</p>
        <p>D3 provides an extensive set of interpolations functions for blending between to values.
          Here we use <code>d3.interpolateRgb</code> to determine which colour each tile should be based on its value.<br>
          See the <a href="https://github.com/d3/d3-interpolate/blob/master/README.md#d3-interpolate" target="_blank">D3 interpolate documentation</a> for details.</p>
